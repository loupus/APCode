	<p>ELYSEE HANDOUT</p>
	<p>Paris - 15 February 2022</p>
	<p>1. SOUNDBITE (French) Gabriel Attal, French government spokesman:</p>
	<p>"It is obviously a positive sign. It would be a sign of de-escalation that we have been waiting for in the past few weeks. It would also confirm that we were right to re-engage a dialogue. I remind you that the president with his trip to Moscow and talks with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has relaunched the dialogue with Russia precisely to arrive to a stabilization or a de-escalation. It is an important aspect of our strategy, the other being the unity of our allies so we can move forward jointly. So if this is confirmed it is obviously a step in the right direction, we need to continue though. You certainly noticed that when it comes to France there was no overreaction in the past weeks and months on information coming from both sides, so you will allow me to continue on our way of seriousness and dialogue in order to reach the stabilization and then de-escalation."</p>

	<p>2. SOUNDBITE (French) Gabriel Attal, French government spokesman:</p>
	<p>"What I can tell you is that there will be a meeting tomorrow night at the Elysee between the president and heads of states partners of our presence in Sahel in the fight against terrorism. It will be a new and important stage in our dialogue on the adaptation of our military deployment in Sahel. Announcements will be made quickly, it is more a matter of days than weeks."</p>
	<p>STORYLINE</p>
	<p>France on Tuesday expressed satisfaction at reports of withdrawal of some Russian forces from its border with Ukraine.</p>
	<p>Government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said if confirmed, the move would be a step in the right direction. </p>
	<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Moscow is ready for talks with the U.S. and NATO on limits for missile deployments and military transparency.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>The statement followed the Russian Defense Ministry’s announced a partial pullback of troops after military drills, adding to hopes that the Kremlin may not be planning to invade Ukraine imminently. </p>
	<p>The Russian military gave no details on where the troops were pulling back from, or how many.</p>
	<p>On recent developments in the Sahel and Mali, Attal said there would be a conference between coalition partners on Wednesday, followed by announcements on the French presence in the region.</p>
	<p>France is facing its toughest challenge in Africa in years: What to do about thousands of French troops stationed in junta-led Mali, the core of a major international anti-terrorism operation in the increasingly restive Sahel region.</p>
	<p>Mali's coup leaders ordered France's ambassador to leave the West African country earlier this month, the latest episode in a growing diplomatic crisis between Mali and its African neighbours and European partners.</p>
	<p>A military pullout from Mali, where French forces have been active since 2013, would shake up the region.</p>
