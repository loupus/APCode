	<p>6. SOUNDBITE (English) Dr Neil Wilkin, curator of Early Europe, The British Museum:</p>
	<p>"In the exhibition, we explore the history of Stonehenge, we pull apart the different periods in which it was built and modified, and what we show is that there was no one Stonehenge. There were many different monuments that meant different things to different people at different times. And so you'll learn about how Stonehenge was at one time in its history a cemetery, for instance. And then later on, it became a place that's much more like a cathedral, somewhere where people went to worship and undertake ceremonies."</p>
	<p>7. Various of standing stones, about 2500 BC, from Lombardy, Italy</p>
	<p>8. Mid of shield and what is believed to be the first ever prosthetic hand for a casualty of war</p>
	<p>9. Various of bronze and gold prosthetic hand, 1500-1400 BC, from Bern, Switzerland</p>
	<p>10. Various of human remains, 2575-2450 BC, found in Wennungen, Germany</p>
	<p>11. Tilt up of cabinet of burial items</p>
	<p>12. Various of a chalk and bone 'drum' sculpture, recently discovered as a burial item in the grave of three children, about 3000 BC, found in Burton Agnes, Yorkshire, UK</p>
	<p>13.SOUNDBITE (English) Dr Neil Wilkin, curator of Early Europe, The British Museum:</p>
	<p>"The archeological significance of the new discovery is is twofold. Firstly, the drum tells us about the connectivity of the times, of the fact that people right across Britain and Ireland were sharing very similar motifs and symbols and probably religious ideas, despite the fact that movement across the country in those days must have been very difficult. There were no roads and certainly no easy ways of moving around. The other significant fact about the drum is that it was buried with three children. And this is a very rare thing at this time. And what it allows us to do is to kind of come face to face with a moment in time, a very sad, poignant moment, and feel a sense of connection with people, with parents."</p>
	<p>14. Wide of exhibition</p>
	<p>15. Close of sandstone block found in burial mound, carved with pattern of daggers and axes, about 2000 - 1500 BC, found in Dorset, UK</p>
	<p>16. Various of 'Seahenge', a monument made of oak, discovered buried on a beach, 2049 BC, found in Holme-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, UK</p>
	<p>17. SOUNDBITE (English) Dr Neil Wilkin, curator of Early Europe, The British Museum:</p>
	<p>"What's astonishing about Seahenge is its survival. So we know from dating the wood that it was constructed in 2049 B.C. in the spring or summer. So it's over 4000 years, and yet the bark and the wood feels as if it might have been made not so long ago, maybe a year ago. It feels so fresh and urgent. And the monument itself at its heart had this upturned oak with its roots pointing up towards the heavens. And we think that's probably a way in which people tried to bring the underworld, the other world to the surface so they could communicate with the gods or the spirits."</p>
	<p>18. Various of gold cape, buried with a woman, 1900-1600 BC, found in Flintshire, Wales, UK</p>
	<p>19. Various of the Nebra Sky Disc, the oldest known material depiction of cosmic phenomena, about 1600 BC, found in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany</p>
	<p>20. SOUNDBITE (English) Dr Neil Wilkin, curator of Early Europe, The British Museum:</p>
	<p>"One of the star objects in the exhibition is the Nebra Sky disc, and it's a remarkable bronze and gold disc, about the size of a dinner plate. And it's decorated with stars and the crescent moon and the full moon, and it's the first depiction in human history of celestial bodies, in this case the Pleiades constellation, sometimes called the Seven Sisters. That group of stars that was very important to early farmers because the appearance and disappearance of that cluster of stars is often taken as a way of signaling the beginning and end of the farming year."</p>

	<p>21. Various of Stonehenge </p>
	<p>22. SOUNDBITE (English) Heather Sebire, Senior property curator for Stonehenge at English Heritage:</p>
	<p>"They've gathered in lots of artifacts that relate to the time of Stonehenge. And I think they're demonstrating pre-history in general, but they're using Stonehenge as a sort of gateway because it's so iconic and a lot of the things do relate to Stonehenge. But I think it's going to give us a fantastic insight to the fact that those people, in a way, were just like us, but they just had different technologies and everything. It (the exhibition) will be absolutely fantastic. And we hope that by going to exhibition, people will want to come and see the real thing and we look forward to welcoming them when they do come."</p>

	<p>LEADIN:</p>
	<p>A new exhibition about Stonehenge opens at London's British Museum this week.</p>
	<p>It will explore the lives of prehistoric people and the spiritual importance of the standing stones.</p>
	<p>STORYLINE:</p>
	<p>The famous stone circle of Stonehenge sits in the English countryside.</p>
	<p>The instantly recognisable prehistoric monument is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
	<p>Ancient humans first began building here around 5,000 years ago - the stone circle was erected in the late Neolithic period, in about 2500 BC.</p>
	<p>But many of its secrets have been lost over the centuries.</p>
	<p>Who were the people that built it and what was it for?</p>
	<p>A new exhibition at the British Museum in London aims to dig a bit deeper into those mysteries.</p>
	<p>'The world of Stonehenge' brings together 430 objects, including standing stones from other places and objects used by the people who lived around the time the monument was built.</p>
	<p>"In the exhibition, we explore the history of Stonehenge, we pull apart the different periods in which it was built and modified, and what we show is that there was no one Stonehenge. There were many different monuments that meant different things to different people at different times. And so you'll learn about how Stonehenge was at one time in its history a cemetery, for instance. And then later on, it became a place that's much more like a cathedral, somewhere where people went to worship and undertake ceremonies," says Dr Neil Wilkin, an expert in Early Europe at The British Museum and lead curator of the exhibition.</p>
	<p>These standing stones found in Italy show motifs of the sun that were common at that time.</p>
	<p>Stonehenge itself is famous for its alignment with the sun, especially at summer solstice. </p>
	<p>Sun motifs can also be seen on what is believed to be the first ever prosthetic hand for a casualty of war.</p>
	<p>It was made from bronze and gold, around 1,000 years after the Stonehenge stone circle was erected.</p>
	<p>Death also gives clues about the lives of Stonehenge-era communities.</p>
	<p>These human remains of a man and woman found in Germany would have been buried to align with the rising sun.</p>
	<p>Objects reflecting their lives were found alongside them.</p>
	<p>Another ancient grave has revealed an interesting object.</p>
	<p>This chalk sculpture was discovered in 2015, buried alongside the bodies of three children in Burton Agnes, Yorkshire in northern  England. </p>
	<p>It's been described as the most important prehistoric discovery for a century.</p>
	<p>"The archeological significance of the new discovery is is twofold. Firstly, the drum tells us about the connectivity of the times, of the fact that people right across Britain and Ireland were sharing very similar motifs and symbols and probably religious ideas, despite the fact that movement across the country in those days must have been very difficult. There were no roads and certainly no easy ways of moving around," explains Wilkin.</p>
	<p>"The other significant fact about the drum is that it was buried with three children. And this is a very rare thing at this time. And what it allows us to do is to kind of come face to face with a moment in time, a very sad, poignant moment, and feel a sense of connection with people, with parents."</p>
	<p>Of course, Stonehenge itself remains in place at its site in Wiltshire.</p>
	<p>So the exhibition relies on other objects to tell its tale.</p>
	<p>That includes the so-called 'Seahenge', a timber circle found buried on a beach in Norfolk.</p>
	<p>It was erected around the same time Stonehenge was built.</p>
	<p>There was some controversy when the decision was taken to remove Seahenge from its location.</p>
	<p>But its appearance in the exhibition gives another insight into how people at that time lived.</p>
	<p>"What's astonishing about Seahenge is its survival. So we know from dating the wood that it was constructed in 2049 B.C. in the spring or summer. So it's over 4000 years, and yet the bark and the wood feels as if it might have been made not so long ago, maybe a year ago. It feels so fresh and urgent," says Wilkin.</p>
	<p>"And the monument itself at its heart had this upturned oak with its roots pointing up towards the heavens. And we think that's probably a way in which people tried to bring the underworld, the other world to the surface so they could communicate with the gods or the spirits."</p>
	<p>Spirituality may also be behind this gold cape.</p>
	<p>It was buried with a woman in around 2000 BC in Leicestershire.</p>
	<p>One theory is that she was a leader or a priestess and wore this during ceremonies.</p>
	<p>The night sky is the subject of this disc.</p>
	<p>The Nebra Sky Disc was made using gold from Cornwall and bronze from central Europe. It was found in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. </p>
	<p>Like Stonehenge, it could position of the rising and setting sun.</p>
	<p>Wilkin says its one of the "star objects" in the exhibition.</p>
	<p>"It's decorated with stars and the crescent moon and the full moon, and it's the first depiction in human history of celestial bodies, in this case the Pleiades constellation, sometimes called the Seven Sisters. That group of stars that was very important to early farmers because the appearance and disappearance of that cluster of stars is often taken as a way of signaling the beginning and end of the farming year," he explains.</p>
	<p>The British Museum and Stonehenge are almost 90 miles apart.</p>
	<p>But custodians of the prehistoric site think the exhibition will tell people about the stone circle and much more.</p>
	<p>"I think they're demonstrating pre-history in general, but they're using Stonehenge as a sort of gateway because it's so iconic and a lot of the things do relate to Stonehenge. But I think it's going to give us a fantastic insight to the fact that those people, in a way, were just like us, but they just had different technologies," says Heather Sebire, senior property curator for Stonehenge at English Heritage.</p>
	<p>"We hope that by going to exhibition, people will want to come and see the real thing and we look forward to welcoming them when they do come."</p>
	<p>'The world of Stonehenge' opens on February 17 and runs until 17 July.</p>
